new classifier used:  K-Nearest Neighbors<br><br/>
explanation of its accuracy: <br><br/>
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier achieved an accuracy of 96.3%, performing slightly below Random Forest and other top classifiers due to its sensitivity to class overlap and boundary proximity. Its effectiveness relies heavily on feature scaling and works well for small, well-separated datasets like the Wine dataset.
